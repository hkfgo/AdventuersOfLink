My final project for Comp 160 class at Rice University. This is a 2D Arcade game inspired by original Legend of Zelda games.

Implemented features include game menu, multiple enemies, levels and character attacks. I also recently added in some sprite animations.

The main program is extremely long because CodeSkulptor is, unfortunately, not best the code editor.
